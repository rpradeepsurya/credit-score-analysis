# Prerequisites

- **Python**: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. You can check this by running `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **pip**: Make sure you have pip (Python package manager) installed. You can check this by running `pip --version` or `pip3 --version`. If you don't have pip, you can follow the [official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

- **Node.js and npm**: Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager) installed. You can check this by running `node --version` and `npm --version` in your terminal. If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download them from [Node.js' official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- **Angular CLI**: Make sure you have Angular CLI installed globally. You can check this by running `ng --version`. If you don't have Angular CLI, you can install it by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
